# Backbone.js

## About Backbone
Backbone.js is a JavaScript library with a RESTful JSON interface and is based on the model–view–controller application design paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only hard dependency is on one JavaScript library,[2] Underscore.js, plus jQuery for use of the full library.[3] It is designed for developing single-page web applications,[4] and for keeping various parts of web applications (e.g. multiple clients and the server) synchronized.[5] Backbone was created by Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also known for CoffeeScript and Underscore.js.
